In palindrome.rb I present two version of the palendrome method. The first version,
in which I considered the simple solution, *reverse* the incoming string and 
compares it to itself. The second solution, in essence splits the string in *half*
and compares the front of the string to the end of the string. Bench marking 
indicates to me that my first solution is the faster of the two but I present
both for your interpretation (Which is the closest to O(1) time complexity if
any at all?).

Execute the following for instructions on usage.

./palindrome.rb -?
